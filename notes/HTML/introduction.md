**HTML**, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the main markup language for creating web pages and other information that can be displayed in a web browser.

It is written in the form of elements which consist of tags enclosed in angle brackets, such as ``<html>``, within the web page content. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like ``<h1>`` and ``</h1>``, although some tags represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example ``<img>``. In between the opening and closing tags is where one can add text, additional tags, comments and other types of text-based content.

HTML elements form the building blocks of all websites. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. It can also embed scripts written in JavaScript, which is used to create more dynamic interfaces, and stylesheets written in CSS, which is used to style the web page to present a more usable interface than simply having a white background with black text.
