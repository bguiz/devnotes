## Extensions
Common image extensions are .jpg, .png, .tiff, and .gif. The most popular being:

1. **jpeg** The JPEG compression algorithm is at its best on photographs and paintings of realistic scenes with smooth variations of tone and color. For web usage, where the amount of data used for an image is important, JPEG is very popular. JPEG/Exif is also the most common format saved by digital cameras.

2. **gif** GIFs are suitable for sharp-edged line art (such as logos) with a limited number of colors. This takes advantage of the format's lossless compression, which favors flat areas of uniform color with well defined edges. They can be used to store low-color sprite data for games. They can be used for small animations and low-resolution film clips. Since a single GIF image palette is limited to 256 colors, it is not usually used as a format for digital photography. Digital photographers use image file formats capable of reproducing a greater range of colors, such as TIFF, RAW or JPEG.

3.  **png** Similar to jpegs, but are larger files and allow for alpha transparency
