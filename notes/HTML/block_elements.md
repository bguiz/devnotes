"Block-level" is categorization of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) elements, as contrasted with "inline" elements. Block-level elements may appear only within a <body> element. Their most significant characteristic is that they typically are formatted with a line break before and after the element (thereby creating a stand-alone block of content). That is, they take up the width of their containers.
