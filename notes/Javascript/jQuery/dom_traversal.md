These are the ways to traverse the DOM in search of specific elements.

## By selector:

```js
  $('p') /** will select all <p> elements on a page */
```

## By class:

```js
  $('.foo') /** will select all elements with class set to 'foo' */
```

## By id:

```js
  $('#foo') /** will select all elements with id set to foo */
```
