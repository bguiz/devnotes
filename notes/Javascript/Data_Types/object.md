```js
  var x = { cat: 'feline', dog: 'canine' }
```

* used to organize data into key-value pairs

* the keys in an object can be assigned to any data type, including another object

* Values inside of an object are accessed through their keys. You can do this in two ways:

```js
  x["cat"] /** returns feline */
```

```js
  x.cat /** returns feline */
```


## Functions

```js
  var functionName = function(arguments) {
    /** code to execute */
  };
```

* Variables declared inside of a function is only accessible within that funciton, while variables declared outside of functions in the global scope are accessible within any function
