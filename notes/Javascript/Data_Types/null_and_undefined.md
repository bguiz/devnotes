## Null vs Undefined

### Null

The Null type has exactly one value: null.

### Undefined

A variable that has not been assigned a value has the value undefined. See undefined and Undefined for more details.

`undefined` means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. On the other hand, `null` is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value.

Also, `undefined` and `null` are two distinct types: `undefined` is a type itself (`undefined`) while `null` is an object.

Unassigned variables are initialized by JavaScript with a default value of `undefined`. JavaScript never sets a value to `null`. That must be done programmatically.
