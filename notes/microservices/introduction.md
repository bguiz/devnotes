The development of constructing applications in the form of microservices has come about as a way for developers to both provide an easier method of building applications in more maintainable, scalable fashion and to ensure that these applications are built with a higher level of quality to better ensure user happiness. One of the most difficult issues with building large, complex applications is being able to wrap one's head around the entire application. This is especially an issue when you are building a monolithic application, in which it is impossible to understand one particular part of an application without understanding all of its other components. If you build your application with the microservices approach, you will only need to understand how that one component operates.

## What are they?
A microservice is a small autonomous service that can work independent of other services. The goal of a microservice is for it to have a single responsibility and for it to do that one job well.

## Facets of Microservice Architectures

* **Domain-Driven Design**
  Focus on representing the real world in your code and modeling your system in a human-friendly manner.

* **Continuous Delivery**
  Focus on how software should effectively and efficiently get moved into production by promoting the idea that every revision to the "master" branch should be a solid release candidate.

* **Hexagonal Architecture**
  Focuses on building applications in way in which components are not stacked on top of each other, instead being "free-floating" objects that can easily communicate with the other components.

* **On-demand virtualization**

* **Infrastructure automation**

* **Small autonomous teams**
