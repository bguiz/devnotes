## BEM

### Block-Element-Modifier

```css

.button {

}

.button_link {

}

.button_link--is-pressed {

}

```

BEM, or Block-Element-Modifier, is a methodology for constructing the styles for
a website's or web application's styles. This approach is meant to "ensure that
everyone participating in the development of a website is working with the same
codebase and using the same terminology". The idea was crafted by members of the
web development community who noticed that we had a broken system of crafting
websites whereby:

1. Designer designs in Photoshop
2. Front-end developer constructs HTML & CSS
3. Back-end developer constructs server-side templates

Anyone who has worked in this type of environment can agree that its difficult.
Often the designers, front-end developers, and back-end developers can't understand
each other, tensions rise, productivity falls, and the project becomes difficult
to maintain as it grows. The idea behind BEM allows for the design and development
process to be done in a way that accommodates change and gets all members of the
team to work collaboratively with the following goals:

* Fast development and long-lasting results
* Efficiently organize work between teams regardless of size
* Write code that is adaptable and reusable
