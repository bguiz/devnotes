## What is CSS?

<blockquote>
    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language that applies presentation
    (styling, layout, animation) to markup content (such as HTML, XHTML, SVG
    or XML). It is one of the main components of the Open Web Platform.

    CSS allows you to style your content through a set of selectors and
    properties.

    First version: The CSS 1 recommendation was described by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie
    and Bert Bos, and first published in 1996.

    <b>Current stable version:</b> The CSS 2 recommendation was first
    published in 1998, but was not completely finished until 2011,
    despite being effectively stable for a number of years before that.

    <b>Current and future work:</b> The CSS Working group is working on a
    number of "modules", which describe different parts of the technology
    set known as CSS3. Some of these modules are stable, whereas some are
    in an experimental state and don't have much support across browsers.
    There is also work being done on various CSS4 modules, although it will
    be a while until these are ready for production work. See the CSS working
    group current work page for more information on what modules/specifications
    are at what stage of completion.
