## Positioning

The `position` property is used to position an element within its parent element.

### Static
```css
  position: static;
```

Static positioning is the default positioning value for HTML elements and causes
the elements to static on.

### Relative
```css
  position: relative;
```

Relative positioned elements behave in the exact same way as statically positioned
elements, but this setting allows the element to be offset by top, right, bottom,
and left properties. It also allows its children to position themselves relative
to it.

### Absolute
```css
  position: absolute;
```

An absolute positioned element is removed from the normal flow of the document
and can be place anywhere within its closest ancestor whose position is set to
`relative`.

### Fixed
```css
  position: fixed;
```

### inherit
```css
  position: inherit;
```
