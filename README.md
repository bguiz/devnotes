A "living document" for software developers

---

The web has made it easier than ever before to be a software developer. It was allowed us to say up to date with all of the latest and greatest technologies, as well as learn best practices, get helpful hints, and learn new techniques from other members in our community.

We have **Stack Overflow**, **Mozilla Developer Network**, **HTML5 Rocks**, **WebPlatform.org**, and thousands of blogs from developers around the word. The internet is simply steeping in knowledge beyond any of our wildest imaginations.

**So what is a developer to do with all of this information?** Especially when so much of the information out there is conflicts with the other information found elsewhere. This can be a daunting task for any one, and this is why I created **Dev Notes**.

I could have done what many developers do, which is open up a blog somewhere and put all of my thoughts and opinions there. As someone who has read far more blogs than I am willing to admit to, usually when I was just in search of some simple answer to question or bug that had been plaguing me, I knew that wouldn't be the best course of action.

I wanted to created a **"living document"** for all of the web technologies that I come across, that not only explained them in plain language, in a way that all people from novices to seasoned veterans could understand, but also gave some helpful tips about how, when, and why certain techniques should be applied.
